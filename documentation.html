        <h2>Description:</h2>
        This is my first body of work <br> 
        with server-side code and building an API<br> 
        (specifically, a REST API).<br> 
        I built this web app with node.js and JavaScript.<br>
        The app provides users with details<br>
        about different movies, directors, and genres.
